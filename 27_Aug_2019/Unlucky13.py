Code Challenge
  Name: 
    Unlucky 13
  Filename: 
    unlucky.py
  Problem Statement:
    Return the sum of the numbers in the array, returning 0 for an empty array. 
    Except the number 13 is very unlucky, so it does not count and numbers that 
    come immediately after a 13 also do not count
    Take input from user  
  Input: 
    13, 1, 2, 13, 2, 1, 13
  Output:
    3
  Hint:
      Try to use enumerate
"""

uesr =input("Enter the number"))
user1.slipt[:1]



#for i in len(user1):
#    if user1[i] == 13:
#        i += 2
#        print(user1)
